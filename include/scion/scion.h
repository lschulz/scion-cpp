/// \page c-interface C Interface
///
/// The header scion.h provides a C interface to SCION-CPP.
///
/// The sockets exposed by the C interface are based on scion::asio::UDPSocket.
/// TCP is not implemented yet. Both synchronous and asynchronous socket
/// operations are exposed. Asynchronous operations notify the application of
/// I/O completion via callback functions with a user-supplied void pointer as
/// context. In addition to the SCION socket, some additional ASIO classes like
/// timers are exposed in the C API to support development of asynchronous SCION
/// applications in C.
///
/// In order to use the C interface. an application must first create a host
/// context with scion_create_host_context(). I/O related library objects store
/// pointers to the host context, so the context must remain valid and fixed in
/// memory for the entire lifetime of objects created from it. The host context
/// also contains the ASIO event loop which may be controlled using the
/// functions scion_poll(), scion_run(), scion_run_for(), scion_stop(), and
/// scion_restart().
///
/// ### Name Resolution ###
/// SCION name resolution is supported with a synchronous and asynchronous
/// interface through scion_resolve_name() and scion_resolve_name_async(). As in
/// SCION-CPP, a c-ares background thread carries out the actual DNS requests to
/// the systems default resolver, however callbacks are always executed in the
/// application's own threads.
///
/// ### Path Lookup ###
/// SCION path lookup is available as the blocking function scion_query_paths().
/// Asynchronous path lookups are not exposed, as gRPC requires it's own
/// separate event loop which is not provided by the C interface yet.
///
/// ### Socket Addresses ###
/// The API represents SCION addresses as scion_addr structs which contain the
/// ISD-ASN and host address. Socket addresses are stored in sockaddr_scion
/// struct that are analogous to sockaddr_in and sockaddr_in6 for IPv4 and IPv6
/// sockets. The API uses the address family AF_SCION to distinguish SCION
/// addresses from IP. Since AF_SCION is not part of the POSIX socket
/// specification, an arbitrarily chosen integer is assigned to it. If
/// necessary, the preprocessor macro AF_SCION can be set to a different unused
/// value without affecting the library or compatibility with other SCION
/// applications.
///
/// ### Examples ###
